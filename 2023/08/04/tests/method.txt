1st methode
* create a class Grid that will be called by all the pieces
* the coups possibles function takes a piece and matches its positions against all the obstacles on its ways, given its possible mouvements
* to solve for all the pieces, call the class for each piece and return their specific possible mouvements

2nd method (attempted in dojo)
* only create classes for pieces
* calculate possible moves same as in the 1st method
* calculate coups possibles by feeding the piece, the chess grid that contains obstacles,
